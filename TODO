* BUGS
  * Backtrace-Ext-Link-Click for no-spec-file errors doesn't work (because its not ending with line number 'rb:10 in create')
  * app/mailer doesn't work
  * wait for webview and rspactor core deps on startup

* Create Specs  (run through rspactor bin)
* Create doc    (create through rake file)
* Preferences: Add symlink /usr/bin/rspactor checkbox
* Go away from flat file structure (reorganize app/lib etc)
